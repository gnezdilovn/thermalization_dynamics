# thermalization_dynamics
This is a research code by Nikolay Gnezdilov. The code implements the time evolution of a few-qubit system after a global quench.  The quench induces Gaussian random all-to-all couplings between the qubits. As a result, thermal observables and fluctuations emerge due to averaging the observables over realizations of the quench protocol.
"thermalizer.py" contains functions required to execute the thermalization protocol.
"run_quench_protocol.ipynb" executes the quench protocol and generates the data.
"plotting.ipynb" produces the plots.
